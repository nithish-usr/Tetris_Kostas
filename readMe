Changes required- top to bottom
1. correct issues with brick snapping. make the game board more visible (ie) thicker box outlines, the ones in white
2. bring calculator, notes, and KPI tab in the same level as the game board
3. enable brick rotation in all directions
4. screen size optimization
5. compatible with Mac
6. phone compatible ? maybe
7. make code more modular ? maybe
8. training page - completely filled with bugs, example - tiles moving out of board when resizing
9. arrow keys mapping - for rotating tiles, currently process = double click on tile, then press only right or left arrow. should use all arrows
10. any way to make drag n drop of tiles easier??
